# Stack

A stack is a linear data structure that follow the principle of "**Last In First Out**" (LIFO). This means the last element inserted inside the stack is removed first.

**Example**:

A stack of five plates, where we can put a new plate on top or remove the top plate.

In case we want the plate at the bottom, then we must first remove all the plates on top. This is exactly how the stack data structure works.

## LIFO Principle of Stack

In programming terms, putting an item on top of the stack is called **push** and removing an item is called **pop**.

## Basic Operations of Stack

There are some basic operations that allow us to perform different actions on a stack.

- **Push** - Add an element of the top of stack.
- **Pop** - Remove an element from the top of a stack.
- **IsEmpty** - Check if the stack is empty.
- **IsFull** - Check if the stack is full.
- **Peek** - Get the value of the top element without removing it.
